The file `intercity_railway_stations.csv` is a list of railway stations with intercity connections. These stations are always considered to be railway junctions ("Bahnknoten").

The list was sourced based on the grant [0584](https://www.bav.admin.ch/bav/de/home/themen/alphabetische-themenliste/verzeichnisse/tu-verzeichnis.html) for SBB by the Federal Office of Transport.
This list is not guaranteed to be complete, since intercity trains can stop on stations where they're not required to stop according to the grant.
